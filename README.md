App that allows users to access up-to-date scheduling information for food trucks in the Boston area, and to rate and review them.

Built in Rails 4, using Rspec and Capybara for testing and Bootstrap for styling. Uses Street Food App's API to populate foodtrucks and schedules, and updates asynchronously with Sidekiq.
